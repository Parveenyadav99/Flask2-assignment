The server then responds with the requested resource, which the client displays to the user.\\nThe GET method can also be used to pass data to the server through query parameters in the URL. For example, if a user enters a search term in a search box on a website and hits \"submit,\" the GET method is used to send the search term to the server in the URL. This is often used in REST APIs to fetch data.\\n\\nPOST Method:\\nThe POST method is used to submit data to a server. When a client submits a form on a website using the POST method, the data entered by the user is sent to the server in the body of the request. The server can then process the data and respond with a new web page or perform some other action.\\nUnlike the GET method, which sends data through query parameters in the URL, the POST method sends data through the request body.
